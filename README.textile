h2. Installation

===============================================================================================

h3. _Warning_

_*Always* check your Notepad++ version at "? > Debug Info" before installing plugins_
_Notepad++ 8.3 is the *minimum required* version for 64-bit releases of HTML Tag 1.2 and newer_

You can safely use any 32-bit version of HTML Tag with any 32-bit version of Notepad++

===============================================================================================

h3. Plugins Admin

A builtin "plugin manager":pl-admin is available in Notepad++ versions 7.6 and newer.

Find _Plugins_ on the main menu bar and select _Plugins Admin_. Check the box beside _HTML Tag_ and click _Install_.

h3. Manual installation

New plugin versions are added to Plugins Admin only when a new Notepad++ release is published.
To use an updated plugin before release, or downgrade to an earlier version, simply replace the plugin's DLL with another one.

*Note*
_This assumes you have already found a compatible version from a trusted source_

Extract the DLL and accompanying files to the plugins folder under @%ProgramFiles%\Notepad++@ (or wherever you're running Notepad++ from).

For 32-bit versions, make sure the plugin folder is named @HTMLTag_unicode@ and the module is named @HTMLTag_unicode.dll@.
Otherwise, the folder should be named @HTMLTag@ and the module @HTMLTag.dll@.

Right-click on @HTMLTag.dll@ (64-bit), or @HTMLTag_unicode.dll@ (32-bit), and select _Properties_.

If the _Unblock_ option is shown, click the checkbox and click _Apply_, then _OK_:

Restart Notepad++ if it's already running.
